This project is a financial aid to do list to be used to help families navigate through the process of completing the requiremenst that are needed to complete the financial aid process. 

Familes are able to navagate to the To Do List section, put the to's in that they need.  When they clicl on a To Do it will indicate that it is complete.  You will be able ot filter through the completed and uncompleted tasks.  There is also a contact for that will allow the user to submit a form to express interest in being contacted or to leave comments.

This project contains the following Technologies:

HTML
CSS
React 
React Router
Redux
Node.js
Javascript

The changes that I will make in the future to improve the app are:

1 Connect the forms to a hosted area to be able to receive the form submission

2 Add more views to create a welcome page

3 Add images to improve the look of the app
